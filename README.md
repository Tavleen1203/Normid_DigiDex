# Building an ML Model for digit recognition ðŸ”¢

ðŸ¤– In this project, we have created an ML model that uses CNN classification algorithm to read digits and ideantify them. We have worked upon a standard MNIST dataset of thousands of digits. By using this dataset, we have trained our model.

We have tested various algorithms and compared their accuracy, precision F1 score and recall to generate the most effective model.

ðŸ“Š Here are the comparisons of various metrics and other relevant plots:

Through this project we got to learn a lot about Machine Learning and AI Models, we learned about data sets and their splitting and the intricacies of training a model.


ðŸ’» The tech stack we used:

1. Python
2. Libraries: matplotlib, pandas, keras, scikit, TensorFlow etc.
3. classification algorithms: CNN, Randon Forest,SVM, KNN, DBN, MLP 
4. Google Collab


ðŸ–‹ END NOTE:
The project was a graet learning experience and really inculcated interests in AI and ML
